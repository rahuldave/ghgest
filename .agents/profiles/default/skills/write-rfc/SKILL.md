# Write RFC

Draft an RFC and store it as a gest artifact. RFCs gather feedback before committing to an approach -- use them for
cross-cutting concerns, public API changes, or proposals that benefit from discussion.

## Instructions

### 1. Draft the RFC

Use the template from `docs/process/writing-rfcs.md`. Key sections:

- **Summary** -- one paragraph explaining the proposal
- **Motivation** -- why are we doing this?
- **Goals / Non-Goals** -- what this does and doesn't aim to address
- **Proposed Design** -- detailed explanation with API examples where helpful
- **Alternatives Considered** -- other designs and why they weren't chosen
- **Unresolved Questions** -- things to answer before or during implementation

### 2. Review with User

Present the draft and iterate. An RFC should be detailed enough for someone unfamiliar with the problem to evaluate the
proposal.

### 3. Save

Create a gest artifact with the RFC content inline:

```sh
GEST_PROJECT_DIR=$XDG_DATA_HOME/gest/2f8de7bc06014bd7 cargo run -- artifact create --title "<title>" --type rfc --body "<content>"
```

Extract the artifact ID from the output.

### 4. Next Step

Print: `share the RFC for feedback, then invoke /plan <id> when ready`
