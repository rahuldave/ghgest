# Brainstorm

Explore a problem space with the user and produce a spec.

## Instructions

### 1. Explore the Problem Space

Read the input provided by the user. Determine the mode:

- **Rough idea** -- the user has a new idea to explore
- **Existing spec** -- the user provides a gest artifact ID to decompose

For rough ideas, delegate to the **brainstormer** agent with the idea. The agent will research the codebase and return a
structured context report covering existing patterns, constraints, complexity, and open questions. Use the research
report to ground the conversation.

For existing specs, retrieve the spec via
`cargo run -- artifact show <id> --json` for structured parsing,
or without `--json` for human-readable output. Identify natural decomposition boundaries.

### 2. Clarify Requirements

Ask clarifying questions **one at a time**. Do not front-load a list of questions. Wait for the user's answer before
asking the next. Use the brainstormer's open questions as a starting point for rough ideas, or scope boundaries for
decomposition.

### 3. Propose Approaches

Once the problem is well-understood, propose **2-3 approaches** with trade-offs and complexity estimates. Ground each
approach in the constraints and existing patterns surfaced by the brainstormer. Ask the user which approach to pursue.

### 4. Draft the Spec

Invoke `/write-spec` with the agreed-upon approach. The skill will output a gest artifact ID for the new spec.

For decomposition, invoke `/write-spec` for each sub-spec, linking them back to the parent.

Print next-step hint: `invoke /plan <id> when you're ready for the next step` (using the spec's gest ID).
