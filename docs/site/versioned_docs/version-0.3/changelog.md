# Changelog

What's new in gest — told version by version.

## v0.3.5

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-31</span>

### Task Notes

Tasks can now carry threaded notes with author attribution. Human authors are identified automatically from your git
config, and agent-authored notes are tagged with `--agent`. Each note includes a timestamp and renders its body as
markdown.

- Add, list, show, update, and delete notes via `gest task note` subcommands
- Notes appear in `task show` output and on the web UI task detail page
- Gravatar avatars and agent badges distinguish human from machine authors

### Iteration Orchestration

New commands make it easier to drive multi-phase work through an iteration without manually juggling task status.

- `iteration status` shows progress at a glance
- `iteration next` peeks at or claims the next available task
- `iteration advance` signals that a phase is complete

### Filtering and Search

- `task list --assigned-to` narrows results by assignee
- `iteration list --has-available` finds iterations with claimable work
- `gest search` now includes iterations in its results

## v0.3.4

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-31</span>

### Security

ID prefix validation now rejects invalid characters, closing a potential path injection vector via crafted entity IDs.

## v0.3.3

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-31</span>

### Web UI Forms

The web UI gained create and edit forms for tasks and artifacts, complete with markdown preview, relationship
management, and inline search — so you can manage your project without leaving the browser.

- Dashboard status cards now link directly to filtered task views
- New/edit buttons on list and detail pages for quick navigation

### Display Improvements

Short ID prefixes are now clickable links throughout the web UI. Tags are clickable for quick filtering, and artifact
type labels are used consistently across all views.

### Bug Fixes

- Store writes now respect whether an entity lives in the active or archive/resolved directory, preventing duplicates
  on mutation
- CLI flags (`--version`, `--verbose`) and shell completion variants now include help text
  ([#24](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/24))

## v0.3.2

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-31</span>

### Built-in Web Server

`gest serve` launches a local web UI with a dashboard, task/artifact/iteration views, a kanban board, and full-text
search — everything you need to browse your project visually
([#13](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/13)–[#23](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/23)).

- `--port`, `--bind`, and `--no-open` flags control the local server
  ([#15](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/15))
- `[serve]` config section with `port`, `bind_address`, and `open` settings
  ([#14](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/14))

### Performance

- Iteration phase counts are now cached instead of recomputed on every read
- `resolve_dot_path` walks by reference instead of cloning, reducing allocations
- Shared helpers consolidated across store operations, CLI metadata handling, and tag/untag commands

### Bug Fixes

- Multi-word `EDITOR` values (e.g. `code --wait`) are now parsed correctly via shell tokenization
- Nested metadata `set_nested` is bounds-checked with a depth limit to prevent stack overflows
- Version line no longer appears in the `--help` banner
- `gest search --expand` now shows full content instead of truncated snippets
  ([#11](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/11))

## v0.3.1

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-30</span>

### Per-Entity Directory Overrides

You can now control where each entity type is stored on disk via `GEST_ARTIFACT_DIR`, `GEST_TASK_DIR`, and
`GEST_ITERATION_DIR` environment variables — or the corresponding `storage.*_dir` config fields.

### Performance

- Blocked-by status resolution for task lists now uses a single batched read pass instead of per-task I/O
- Search filtering avoids redundant string allocations during case-insensitive matching
- Prefix matching exits early after two matches instead of collecting all candidates
- Metadata serialization is skipped during search when maps are empty
- Store functions receive the full application config, removing the need for plumbing changes when new settings are
  accessed

## v0.3.0

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-30</span>

### Breaking Changes

This release includes two breaking changes:

- **TOML-only configuration.** JSON and YAML config files are no longer supported. Rename your config to `gest.toml`
  and convert the contents to TOML.
- **Global store by default.** `gest init` now creates the global data store. Use `gest init --local` if you want an
  in-repo `.gest/` directory.

### New UI

The entire terminal UI has been rebuilt with an atomic architecture (atoms, composites, views) for consistent, aligned
rendering across all commands.

## v0.2.3

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-29</span>

### Iterations

A new entity type for planning multi-phase work. Iterations have their own storage, UI components, CLI commands, and a
graph visualization that shows how tasks flow through phases.

### Richer Task Fields

Tasks now support `priority`, `assigned_to`, and `phase` fields for more structured project tracking.

### Search Improvements

`--expand` on `gest search` now works without `--json`, showing full detail blocks directly in the terminal.

## v0.2.2

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-27</span>

### Update Notifications

`gest version` now checks for newer releases and suggests `gest self-update` when one is available.

### Search Improvements

The `--expand` (`-e`) flag on `gest search` enriches `--json` output with full item details.

### Theme Tokens

New `indicator.blocked` and `indicator.blocking` theme tokens let you customize how task list status indicators look.

### Performance

Reduced unnecessary memory allocations in UI rendering and search, plus extracted shared helpers and removed dead code.

## v0.2.1

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-26</span>

### Bug Fixes

- Install script now downloads the correct checksum file during installation
- Self-update no longer fails with a 404 when fetching the target release

## v0.2.0

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-26</span>

### Shell Completions and Man Pages

New generation commands produce shell completions and man pages for your preferred shell
([#1](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/1)).

### Markdown Rendering

Descriptions are no longer plain text in the terminal. Headings, code blocks, lists, blockquotes, and more are rendered
with styled formatting ([#2](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/2),
[#3](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/3)). Artifact and task detail views use this automatically
([#4](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/4), [#5](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/5)).

### Verbose Logging

Every command, store operation, and config discovery step now emits verbose logs for easier debugging.

### Breaking Change

`artifact list --include-archived` has been renamed to `--all` (`-a`), matching the convention used by task and search
commands.

### Performance

Faster unique ID prefix computation and shorter ID encoding.

### Bug Fixes

Log level semantics now correctly follow the debug=why, trace=result convention.

## v0.1.0

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-26</span>

The first release of gest — a lightweight CLI for tracking AI-agent-generated tasks and artifacts alongside your
project. Ships with `artifact` and `task` commands, TOML/JSON/YAML configuration, search, and editor integration.
