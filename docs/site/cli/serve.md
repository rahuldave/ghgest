# gest serve

Alias: `gest s`

Start the built-in web dashboard for browsing and managing your project's tasks, artifacts, and iterations. While
agents interact with gest through the CLI and `--json` output, the dashboard gives humans a visual overview of
everything that's happening — especially useful when multiple agents are working in parallel across an iteration.

The dashboard provides a status overview, filterable task and artifact lists with rendered Markdown, iteration detail
views with tasks grouped by phase, a kanban board for tracking progress, and full-text search across all entities.

## Configuration

The server reads its settings from the `[serve]` section in your config file. CLI flags override config values.

```toml
[serve]
bind_address = "127.0.0.1"
port = 2300
open = true
```

See [Configuration](/configuration/#serve) for the full reference.

## Examples

```sh
# Start with defaults (localhost:2300, auto-open browser)
gest serve

# Custom port, no browser
gest serve --port 8080 --no-open

# Bind to all interfaces
gest serve --bind 0.0.0.0
```
