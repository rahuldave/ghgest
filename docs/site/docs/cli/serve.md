# gest serve

Alias: `gest s`

Start the built-in web dashboard for browsing and managing your project's tasks, artifacts, and iterations. While
agents interact with gest through the CLI and `--json` output, the dashboard gives humans a visual overview of
everything that's happening — especially useful when multiple agents are working in parallel across an iteration.

The dashboard provides a status overview, filterable task and artifact lists with rendered Markdown, iteration detail
views with tasks grouped by phase, a kanban board for tracking progress, and full-text search across all entities.
