# Changelog

What's new in gest — told version by version.

## v0.5.2

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-04-12</span>

### Project Lifecycle Management

Projects now have a full archive/delete lifecycle. `gest project archive` soft-archives a project — it disappears from
`project list` by default (use `--all` to reveal it with an `[archived]` badge) and detaches from any workspaces.
`gest project unarchive` reverses the operation. For permanent removal, `gest project delete` performs a non-undoable
cascade deletion of the project and all its owned tasks, iterations, and artifacts, with a confirmation prompt showing
exactly what will be removed.

- Archive and unarchive with entity count display and workspace reporting
  ([#38](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/38))
- Cascade delete with tombstone fan-out for sync safety
  ([#38](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/38))

### Bulk Purge

The new `gest purge` command consolidates cleanup into a single operation. It can remove terminal tasks, terminal
iterations, archived artifacts, archived projects, dangling relationships, and orphan tombstones — individually via
selector flags or all at once. `--dry-run` previews what would be removed without touching the database, and `--yes`
bypasses the confirmation prompt for scripted use.

- Selector flags: `--tasks`, `--iterations`, `--artifacts`, `--projects`, `--relationships`,
  `--tombstones` ([#39](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/39))

### Smarter ID Prefixes

List and search output now displays the shortest unique prefix per entity instead of a single shared minimum length
across all IDs of the same type. This means shorter, easier-to-type prefixes for most entities while still guaranteeing
uniqueness.

## v0.5.1

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-04-10</span>

### Web Security and Error Handling

The web dashboard received a comprehensive security and reliability pass. A CSP nonce middleware replaces
the previous `'unsafe-inline'` script/style policy, and new CSRF protection via double-submit signed
cookies guards all mutating requests. Gravatar avatars are now proxied through a first-party
`/avatars/{hash}` endpoint, so the dashboard no longer leaks browsing activity to an external origin and
works in air-gapped environments. Additional security headers — `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`,
`frame-ancestors`, `base-uri`, and `form-action` — round out the hardening.

Error handling has been unified under a single error type. Store "not found" errors now surface as proper
HTTP 404 responses instead of generic 500s, and validation failures return 400 with an HTML error page.

### Web Forms and Usability

Task create and edit forms gained a markdown preview toggle (matching the existing artifact form), and the
priority field is now a dropdown instead of a free-text numeric input — out-of-range values surface as a
user-friendly error with the form fields preserved.

Iteration tags now render as clickable `#` links, matching the pattern used in task and artifact views.

### Performance

Web list pages (tasks, iterations, artifacts) now batch tag and relationship lookups into two queries
instead of issuing per-row fan-out, and a new status counts query replaces the double-pass
count-then-filter pattern on the dashboard.

### Priority Labels

`--priority` on `task create` and `task update` now accepts `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, and
`lowest` (case-insensitive) in addition to the 0–4 integer form.

### Iteration Graph

The iteration graph view has been rebuilt with phase headers, `◆` icons, parallel column indicators with
branch-drawing connectors, priority badges, and blocked/blocking dependency markers — restoring and
extending the detail level from v0.4.4.

### CLI Improvements

- `--json` output on entity commands now uses an Envelope format that includes relationships, tags, and
  notes alongside the entity data
- `--batch` flag on `iteration add` supports bulk NDJSON task addition with per-record phase control and
  all-or-nothing rollback semantics
- `--tag` and `--tags` arguments accept comma-separated values (e.g. `--tag a,b`)
- Confirmation prompts use an interactive Yes/No selector with arrow-key navigation instead of text input
- Rendered markdown headings in terminal output now show `#` level markers for visual distinction

## v0.5.0

v0.5.0 is the storage rewrite. Entity data moves from flat TOML/Markdown files under `.gest/` into a
single SQLite database (via libsql), and project identity becomes explicit so multiple worktrees of
the same repo can share a live view of the same tasks, artifacts, and iterations. Existing v0.4.x
projects import in one shot — see the
[v0.4 → v0.5 migration guide](./migration/v0-4-to-v0-5.md) for the full upgrade path, data mapping, and
rollback procedure.

### SQLite-First Storage

Entity data now lives in `<data_dir>/gest.db` — a single libsql database that holds tasks, artifacts,
iterations, notes, relationships, tags, events, and undo history in one place. Multi-entity writes
are atomic (so a task plus its tags plus its relationships land together or not at all), and
concurrent agents can hit the same store without fighting over flat-file locks.

For local-mode projects, `.gest/` sticks around as a **sync mirror**: the database is the source of
truth, but every mutation rewrites a set of human-readable YAML/Markdown files under `.gest/task/`,
`.gest/artifact/`, and `.gest/iteration/` (singular subdirectories, a small rename from the v0.4.x
plural layout) so the data stays inspectable and git-committable. Disable the mirror with
`storage.sync = false` or `GEST_STORAGE__SYNC=false` if you want the database only.

A new `[database]` config section lets you point gest at a remote libsql/Turso instance. Set `url`
directly, or provide `scheme`, `host`, `port`, `username`, `password`, and `auth_token`
individually:

```toml
[database]
url = "libsql://my-project.turso.io"
auth_token = "..."
```

Existing v0.4.x projects are imported with `gest migrate --from v0.4`. The migrator auto-discovers
both the local-mode `.gest/` layout and the global-mode `~/.local/share/gest/<hash>/` layout, preserves
every ID so external references (commit messages, PR bodies) keep working, and prints a summary of
what it imported. The guide walks through the details.

### Workspaces

In v0.4.x, two worktrees of the same repo produced two entirely separate stores: local mode wrote to
the worktree's own `.gest/`, and global mode keyed the project row by hashing the current working
directory, so each checkout got a different hash. Parallel agents couldn't share a project.

v0.5.0 makes project identity explicit. A project is a row in the database, identified by an assigned
ID. Additional checkouts opt in by **attaching** as a workspace:

```sh
# In the original checkout, find the project ID
gest project

# In a second worktree, attach to it
cd ../myapp-feature-a
gest project attach <project-id>
```

After attaching, both checkouts resolve to the same project row and share the same tasks, artifacts,
and iterations in real time. `gest project detach` reverses the operation, and `gest project list`
shows all known projects across your machine.

### Artifact Notes

Artifacts now support the same note management surface as tasks. Use `gest artifact note add`,
`list`, `show`, `update`, and `delete` to attach human- or agent-authored annotations to a spec, ADR,
or RFC over time. Notes appear in `artifact show` output and on the web UI artifact detail page,
with the same Gravatar avatars and agent badges you already get on task notes.

### Entity Deletion

Tasks and artifacts can now be hard-deleted from the store. `gest task delete <id>` and
`gest artifact delete <id>` remove the entity and all its dependent rows (notes, relationships, tags,
events). Both commands prompt for confirmation interactively; pass `--yes` to skip the prompt in
scripts. `task delete` additionally requires `--force` when the task is still a member of one or more
iterations — this keeps active sprint members from being removed by accident.

Destructive note commands (`task note delete`, `artifact note delete`) now prompt by default as well,
with the same `--yes` escape hatch.

### Theme Overhaul

The theme system has been rebuilt around a new token hierarchy and richer palette semantics, and the
default palette has been retuned across the CLI and web UI. Rather than inlining the full token list
here, see the [theming reference](./configuration/theming.md) for the complete set of tokens, the palette
slots they cascade from, and examples for overriding them in your `gest.toml`.

### New Flags and Ergonomics

- **`gest task claim <id>`** assigns the task to the current author and marks it in-progress in a
  single step — handy when picking up the next available task from an iteration
- **`--raw` (`-r`) output flag** on entity commands produces script-friendly plain output without
  themed styling, giving you a third output mode alongside the default human-readable and `--json`
  shapes
- **`--limit <N>`** on `task list`, `iteration list`, `artifact list`, and `gest search` caps result
  counts for faster scanning of large projects
- **`--metadata-json`** on create and update commands merges a JSON object into metadata on top of
  any `--metadata key=value` pairs, so you can set structured values in one shot without repeated
  `-m` flags
- **`gest artifact create`** gained `-i`/`--iteration` (link a new artifact to an iteration inline)
  and `-s`/`--source` (read the body from a file path instead of stdin or `$EDITOR`)
- **`gest config get storage.data_dir`** returns the resolved path instead of `null` when no explicit
  override is set

### Breaking Changes

- **Storage format changed to SQLite.** Existing v0.4.x projects must be imported with
  `gest migrate --from v0.4`. The migrator never touches the source files, so your old `.gest/` stays
  intact as a backup until you remove it yourself. Follow the
  [migration guide](./migration/v0-4-to-v0-5.md) for details.
- **Artifact `kind` field removed.** Categorization is tag-driven now. The migrator converts
  `kind: "spec"` into a `spec` tag automatically.
- **`artifact create` CLI reshaped.** The command takes a positional `[TITLE]` argument; the `--title`
  and `--type` flags are gone, and `-t` is now a shortcut for `--tag` instead of `--type`.
- **`type:` search filter removed.** Use `tag:<name>` instead (e.g. `gest search 'tag:spec'`). If you
  had `type:` queries in personal aliases or scripts, update them.
- **Environment variables renamed or removed.** `GEST_LOG_LEVEL` is now `GEST_LOG__LEVEL` (double
  underscore). `GEST_DATA_DIR` is now `GEST_STORAGE__DATA_DIR`. `GEST_PROJECT_DIR`, `GEST_STATE_DIR`,
  `GEST_ARTIFACT_DIR`, `GEST_TASK_DIR`, and `GEST_ITERATION_DIR` are all gone — the new storage model
  has no per-entity directory overrides.
- **Config fields removed.** `storage.project_dir`, `storage.state_dir`, `storage.artifact_dir`,
  `storage.task_dir`, and `storage.iteration_dir` are no longer honored; delete them from existing
  `gest.toml` files.
- **Undo state lives in the database.** There is no longer a separate state directory; undo history
  follows whichever database the command ran against.

## v0.4.4

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-04-04</span>

### Security Headers

The web server now sets `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `X-Content-Type-Options` on
every response, hardening the default setup against clickjacking and content-type sniffing.

### Bug Fixes

- The `-q` flag on mutation commands was printing the full 32-character ID — it now outputs the
  8-character short ID, matching how IDs are displayed everywhere else
- Store writes use the `tempfile` crate for proper temporary files, avoiding collisions when multiple
  agents write concurrently
- `config get storage.project_dir` now returns the resolved path instead of `null` when no explicit
  override is set ([#31](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/31))

### Performance

Iteration orchestration operations (`all_phases`, `assignees`, `phases_with_incomplete`) now use
sort+dedup instead of HashSet round-trips, and an unnecessary double-clone has been eliminated.

## v0.4.3

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-04-03</span>

### Iteration Cancel and Reopen

Iterations can now be cancelled and reopened with dedicated commands. `gest iteration cancel <id>`
marks the iteration as cancelled and automatically cascades to all non-terminal tasks — open and
in-progress tasks become cancelled, while done tasks are left untouched. `gest iteration reopen <id>`
reverses the operation, restoring the iteration and its cancelled tasks. The old `failed` status
remains as a deprecated alias for backward compatibility.

### Live Reload

The web UI now updates in real time. When you change project files on disk, pages connected to the
web server receive updates via server-sent events and swap in fresh content without a full reload.
The file watcher debounce defaults to 2000ms and is configurable via `serve.debounce_ms`.

### Request Logging

Every HTTP request to the web server is now logged with method, path, response status, and elapsed
time. Control the verbosity with the `serve.log_level` setting (default: info).

### Web Dashboard

The dashboard task card now shows only actionable work (open + in-progress) rather than all tasks.
A new iteration status breakdown row shows active, completed, and cancelled counts with links to
filtered views.

### Bug Fixes

- `read_from_editor` no longer drops content due to a missing return statement

## v0.4.2

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-04-02</span>

### Ergonomics Everywhere

This release is all about reducing friction. Nearly every common workflow got shorter.

**Command aliases** let you move faster: `gest t` instead of `gest task`, `gest a` for `gest artifact`,
`gest i` for `gest iteration`, `gest grep` for `gest search`. Subcommands gained natural aliases too —
`new`, `ls`, `view`, `edit`, and `rm` all work where you'd expect. Top-level `u` and `s` shortcuts
round out `undo` and `serve`.

**Lifecycle shortcuts** — `task complete`, `task cancel`, and `task block` — handle the most common
status transitions in a single command instead of `task update --status`.

**Tags got simpler.** A unified `--tag` flag works on both create and update commands, and tag/untag
commands accept comma-separated values (`gest task tag <id> rust,cli`) so you can apply multiple tags
in one shot.

### Machine-Readable Output

Every mutation command now accepts `--json` for structured output and `-q` for bare IDs — making gest
a first-class citizen in shell pipelines and automation scripts. `meta get` gained `--json` and `--raw`
variants for programmatic value access.

### Batch and Pipeline Support

The new `--batch` flag reads NDJSON from stdin to create multiple tasks or artifacts in a single
invocation. Body and description fields can also be piped from stdin implicitly, so `echo "notes" |
gest task create "my task"` just works.

Create commands gained `-i`/`--iteration` to add the new entity to an iteration inline, and `task
create` supports `-l`/`--link` for creating relationships at creation time — no follow-up commands
needed.

### Search Paging

Search output is now paged through `$PAGER` (falling back to `less -R`) when stdout is a terminal.
Piped and redirected output bypasses the pager automatically.

### Under the Hood

Entity operations are now backed by generic trait-based action functions, and catch-all error variants
have been replaced with domain-specific types that produce clearer diagnostics. Tag list tables now
render with proper theme formatting.

## v0.4.1

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-04-01</span>

### Search Filters

`gest search` now understands structured queries. Use `is:`, `tag:`, `status:`, and `type:` prefixes to narrow results —
negate any filter with a `-` prefix (e.g. `-status:done`). Filters of the same type OR-combine, and different filter
types AND-combine, giving you precise control without complex syntax.

### Reliability and Safety

A batch of fixes hardens the store and web server:

- Entity file moves are now atomic (write-to-temp then rename), closing a TOCTOU race that could leave partial files on
  disk
- Unrecognized event types produce a clear error instead of panicking
- HTML error responses are sanitized to prevent reflected XSS
- Dashboard errors are logged instead of silently swallowed
- Task link mutations use a dedicated patch field for atomicity
- CLI metadata values are parsed as typed TOML (numbers, booleans) rather than always strings
- Native TOML datetimes are deserialized correctly
- Integer casts in orchestration replaced with correct types
- UI text truncation no longer panics on edge-case inputs

## v0.4.0

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-04-01</span>

### Undo

You can now reverse the most recent mutating command with `gest undo`. Under the hood, a new SQLite-backed event store
captures before/after snapshots of every file mutation. If something goes wrong, `gest undo` restores the previous state
in one step. The event store location is configurable via `GEST_STATE_DIR` or `storage.state_dir`.

### Tags

New `gest tag add|remove|list` subcommands let you manage tags on any entity. `gest tags` lists all tags across the
project with optional entity-type filtering. Tags are a lightweight way to categorize and find related work.

### Activity Timeline

Task and iteration status, phase, and priority changes are now recorded automatically as events with author attribution.
The `show` views merge events and notes into a single chronological activity timeline — in both the CLI and the web UI —
so you can see the full history of an entity at a glance.

### Theming Overhaul

Color configuration has been restructured into two tiers: `[colors.palette]` defines 11 semantic color slots, and
`[colors.overrides]` provides per-token customization. Palette colors cascade through to all tokens that reference a
given slot, making it easy to restyle the entire UI by changing a few palette values. `config show` now displays palette
and override counts separately.

### Web UI Accessibility

The web UI received a comprehensive accessibility pass to meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements:

- Semantic HTML landmarks and a skip-to-content link for screen readers
- Heading hierarchy with proper `h1`–`h6` elements
- Font sizes converted to `rem` units respecting browser preferences
- Color contrast updated to meet the 4.5:1 minimum ratio
- Focus-visible outlines on all interactive elements for keyboard navigation
- ARIA labels on form fields and the relationship modal
- Keyboard-accessible relationship modal with focus trap and Escape-to-close

### Cross-Entity IDs

ID generation now checks for prefix collisions across all entity types before assigning a short ID, and a new
cross-entity resolver can look up any entity by prefix with ambiguity detection. The `--no-color` global flag is also
available for scripting.

### Breaking Changes

This release bundles several breaking changes:

- **`GEST_DATA_DIR` semantics changed.** It now points to the global root (e.g. `~/.local/share/gest`) instead of the
  project-specific directory. Use the new `GEST_PROJECT_DIR` env var or `storage.project_dir` config field for the old
  behavior.
- **Color config restructured.** The flat `[colors]` section is replaced by `[colors.palette]` and `[colors.overrides]`.
- **Project discovery tightened.** Only `.gest/` directories are matched during walk-up discovery; unrelated directories
  named `gest/` are no longer false positives.
- **Empty datetime fields omitted.** Task and iteration TOML files no longer write `resolved_at = ""` or
  `completed_at = ""`. Existing files with empty strings are still read correctly.

### Bug Fixes

- `config set` now writes typed TOML values instead of wrapping everything as strings
- Event recording no longer silently skipped when git `user.name` is unset

## v0.3.5

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-31</span>

### Task Notes

Tasks can now carry threaded notes with author attribution. Human authors are identified automatically from your git
config, and agent-authored notes are tagged with `--agent`. Each note includes a timestamp and renders its body as
markdown.

- Add, list, show, update, and delete notes via `gest task note` subcommands
- Notes appear in `task show` output and on the web UI task detail page
- Gravatar avatars and agent badges distinguish human from machine authors

### Iteration Orchestration

New commands make it easier to drive multi-phase work through an iteration without manually juggling task status.

- `iteration status` shows progress at a glance
- `iteration next` peeks at or claims the next available task
- `iteration advance` signals that a phase is complete

### Filtering and Search

- `task list --assigned-to` narrows results by assignee
- `iteration list --has-available` finds iterations with claimable work
- `gest search` now includes iterations in its results

## v0.3.4

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-31</span>

### Security

ID prefix validation now rejects invalid characters, closing a potential path injection vector via crafted entity IDs.

## v0.3.3

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-31</span>

### Web UI Forms

The web UI gained create and edit forms for tasks and artifacts, complete with markdown preview, relationship
management, and inline search — so you can manage your project without leaving the browser.

- Dashboard status cards now link directly to filtered task views
- New/edit buttons on list and detail pages for quick navigation

### Display Improvements

Short ID prefixes are now clickable links throughout the web UI. Tags are clickable for quick filtering, and artifact
type labels are used consistently across all views.

### Bug Fixes

- Store writes now respect whether an entity lives in the active or archive/resolved directory, preventing duplicates
  on mutation
- CLI flags (`--version`, `--verbose`) and shell completion variants now include help text
  ([#24](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/24))

## v0.3.2

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-31</span>

### Built-in Web Server

`gest serve` launches a local web UI with a dashboard, task/artifact/iteration views, a kanban board, and full-text
search — everything you need to browse your project visually
([#13](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/13)–[#23](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/23)).

- `--port`, `--bind`, and `--no-open` flags control the local server
  ([#15](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/15))
- `[serve]` config section with `port`, `bind_address`, and `open` settings
  ([#14](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/14))

### Performance

- Iteration phase counts are now cached instead of recomputed on every read
- `resolve_dot_path` walks by reference instead of cloning, reducing allocations
- Shared helpers consolidated across store operations, CLI metadata handling, and tag/untag commands

### Bug Fixes

- Multi-word `EDITOR` values (e.g. `code --wait`) are now parsed correctly via shell tokenization
- Nested metadata `set_nested` is bounds-checked with a depth limit to prevent stack overflows
- Version line no longer appears in the `--help` banner
- `gest search --expand` now shows full content instead of truncated snippets
  ([#11](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/11))

## v0.3.1

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-30</span>

### Per-Entity Directory Overrides

You can now control where each entity type is stored on disk via `GEST_ARTIFACT_DIR`, `GEST_TASK_DIR`, and
`GEST_ITERATION_DIR` environment variables — or the corresponding `storage.*_dir` config fields.

### Performance

- Blocked-by status resolution for task lists now uses a single batched read pass instead of per-task I/O
- Search filtering avoids redundant string allocations during case-insensitive matching
- Prefix matching exits early after two matches instead of collecting all candidates
- Metadata serialization is skipped during search when maps are empty
- Store functions receive the full application config, removing the need for plumbing changes when new settings are
  accessed

## v0.3.0

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-30</span>

### Breaking Changes

This release includes two breaking changes:

- **TOML-only configuration.** JSON and YAML config files are no longer supported. Rename your config to `gest.toml`
  and convert the contents to TOML.
- **Global store by default.** `gest init` now creates the global data store. Use `gest init --local` if you want an
  in-repo `.gest/` directory.

### New UI

The entire terminal UI has been rebuilt with an atomic architecture (atoms, composites, views) for consistent, aligned
rendering across all commands.

## v0.2.3

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-29</span>

### Iterations

A new entity type for planning multi-phase work. Iterations have their own storage, UI components, CLI commands, and a
graph visualization that shows how tasks flow through phases.

### Richer Task Fields

Tasks now support `priority`, `assigned_to`, and `phase` fields for more structured project tracking.

### Search Improvements

`--expand` on `gest search` now works without `--json`, showing full detail blocks directly in the terminal.

## v0.2.2

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-27</span>

### Update Notifications

`gest version` now checks for newer releases and suggests `gest self-update` when one is available.

### Search Improvements

The `--expand` (`-e`) flag on `gest search` enriches `--json` output with full item details.

### Theme Tokens

New `indicator.blocked` and `indicator.blocking` theme tokens let you customize how task list status indicators look.

### Performance

Reduced unnecessary memory allocations in UI rendering and search, plus extracted shared helpers and removed dead code.

## v0.2.1

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-26</span>

### Bug Fixes

- Install script now downloads the correct checksum file during installation
- Self-update no longer fails with a 404 when fetching the target release

## v0.2.0

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-26</span>

### Shell Completions and Man Pages

New generation commands produce shell completions and man pages for your preferred shell
([#1](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/1)).

### Markdown Rendering

Descriptions are no longer plain text in the terminal. Headings, code blocks, lists, blockquotes, and more are rendered
with styled formatting ([#2](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/2),
[#3](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/3)). Artifact and task detail views use this automatically
([#4](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/4), [#5](https://github.com/aaronmallen/gest/issues/5)).

### Verbose Logging

Every command, store operation, and config discovery step now emits verbose logs for easier debugging.

### Breaking Change

`artifact list --include-archived` has been renamed to `--all` (`-a`), matching the convention used by task and search
commands.

### Performance

Faster unique ID prefix computation and shorter ID encoding.

### Bug Fixes

Log level semantics now correctly follow the debug=why, trace=result convention.

## v0.1.0

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>2026-03-26</span>

The first release of gest — a lightweight CLI for tracking AI-agent-generated tasks and artifacts alongside your
project. Ships with `artifact` and `task` commands, TOML/JSON/YAML configuration, search, and editor integration.
