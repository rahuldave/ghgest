Manage agent-generated artifacts and task backlogs alongside your project.

Gest is a CLI tool for tracking tasks and artifacts generated during AI-assisted development. Data is stored as plain
files — TOML for tasks, Markdown with YAML frontmatter for artifacts — and can live inside your repo (`.gest/`) or in an
external data directory.

## Quick Start

```sh
gest init                                    # initialize global store
gest task create "Implement auth middleware"
gest artifact create --file auth-spec.md
gest search "auth"
```

Use `gest init --local` to store data inside the repo (`.gest/`) instead of the global data directory.

## Commands

| Command          | Description                                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gest init`      | Initialize gest (`--local` for in-repo `.gest/` directory)     |
| `gest task`      | Create, list, show, update, tag, link, and manage tasks        |
| `gest artifact`  | Create, list, show, update, tag, archive, and manage artifacts |
| `gest search`    | Search across tasks and artifacts                              |
| `gest config`    | View and modify configuration                                  |

Run `gest --help` or `gest <command> --help` for full details.

## Configuration

Gest loads configuration from global (`~/.config/gest/`) and project-level files, supporting TOML, JSON, and YAML
formats. Run `gest config show` to see the resolved configuration and its source files.

## Installation

### Quick Install (macOS and Linux)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronmallen/gest/main/script/install.sh | sh
```

> [!TIP]
> This installs `doing` to `~/.local/bin`. Make sure it's in your `PATH`:
>
>```sh
>export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
>```

Pin a specific version or change the install directory:

```sh
GEST_VERSION=0.0.1 GEST_INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local/bin \
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronmallen/gest/main/script/install.sh | sh
```

### Cargo

```sh
cargo install gest
```

Or with [cargo-binstall] for a pre-built binary:

```sh
cargo binstall gest
```

## Status
